00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:01,780
[Episode 1]

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,420
On that day, all the humans around the world

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,540
turned into stone.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,030
Senku, listen to me.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,490
I've decided.

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,570
Today I will confess my five years of feelings
to Yuzuriha!

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,560
That sounds interesting.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,260
I will be in this laboratory, cheering for you at the top of my lungs.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,540
Really? Thank you, Senku!

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,850
Shut up. I'm not planning on supporting you
at all, big guy.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,700
What? What is it gonna be?

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,360
Besides, you haven't said anything in five years.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,470
That's totally unreasonable, you fool.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,610
Let me give you something reasonable.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,010
This is a love potion that will accelerate your
pheromone secretion.

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,180
If you drink this, your success rate will be 100%.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,760
Thank you, Senku.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,000
But I'm sorry,

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,450
I won't use this kind of sham.

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,070
Senku, is that love potion real?

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,220
How can there be such a thing?

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,390
It's just a flask of gasoline.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,970
I made it from plastic bottle caps.

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,570
Think about the molecular structure of
polyethylene, you fool.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,080
Itâ€™s just a hydrocarbon in the gasoline
component.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,980
You can see that, right?

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,220
No, I can't.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,230
Who could?

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,260
So if Taiju drank it, he'd be dead now?

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,840
I was 100% sure he wouldn't drink it.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,300
He's too much of an honest fool.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,660
Yuzuriha!

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,470
I'm sorry I made you wait!

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,370
So tell me, what is it, Taiju?

36
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,890
What did you want to tell me?

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,550
I bet you 100 yen he gets rejected.

38
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,360
300 yen he gets rejected mercilessly.

39
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,650
500 yen he gets rejected full force.

40
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,720
10 thousand yen he unexpectedly doesn't
get rejected.

41
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,750
Are you serious?

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm really afraid that if I confess

43
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,190
I can't even stay friends with Yuzuriha anymore.

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,070
I... have been avoiding it.

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,110
Hear me out, Yuzuriha!

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,850
But today I will...

47
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,000
For the past five years, I've...

48
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,710
That light, what is that?

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,590
Yuzuriha, grab onto that camphor tree!

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,710
I don't know, but...

51
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,280
I can't speak. Someone help me...

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,864
What's happening?

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,660
Help! Help!

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,040
What's happening?

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,120
Help me! Mom! Dad!

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,460
Am I gonna die like this?

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,660
I'm not dead!

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,470
If I let my guard down I'll get sucked in.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,010
I have to wake up!

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,050
Yuzuriha must be alright.

61
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,870
She must be alright.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,720
I can't just die so stupidly.

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,350
I have to tell Yuzuriha my feelings!

64
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,870
I have to live on by perseverance!

65
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,540
Even if it takes weeks, or months,

66
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,780
I will say it! I will!

67
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,260
Since then, a few decades have passed, then
a few centuries, then a few millenniums.

68
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I won't lose.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,250
I will confess to Yuzuriha!

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,910
No matter what, I will live!

71
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm out! I'm finally out!

72
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,170
A piece of rock?

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,680
Oh, that's right, everyone is...

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,940
like that.

75
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,790
How much time has passed?

76
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,910
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,250
This is all I can do now.

78
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,260
As long as the terrain hasn't changed too much

79
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,450
I should be able to go back following
the river.

80
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,200
Go back to that camphor tree.

81
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,930
Something fell down.

82
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,450
A little bird's stone statue?

83
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,530
The person who made this must be amazing!

84
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,210
The details of the feathers are so fine!

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,770
It looks like it's real!

86
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,300
But it is real, isn't it?

87
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,980
My friend sent me a photo, said he saw it
elsewhere, too.

88
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,740
Poor bird.

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,490
Perhaps it fell ill with some bird disease
that ossifies the skin.

[Visiting Hours]
[Weekdays]
[Weekends and Holidays]

91
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
How can the veterinary clinic be open
before classes?

92
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,970
You are so thoughtless.

93
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,530
Yuzuriha!

94
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,610
Also, treating that sculpture like a real bird
and coming to the veterinary clinic...

95
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,350
is so stupid and embarrassing.

96
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,180
Of course, Yuzuriha, the one I hoped not

97
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,130
to see my stupid side, is now
the one to bump into me.

98
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,690
Bumped into?

99
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,810
Yes, there is another one here

100
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,760
who does things thoughtlessly and who's
very embarrassed.

101
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,740
What? Don't laugh at me! Aren't you the same?

102
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,120
We are both late for school!

103
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,190
Oh, that's right.

104
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,420
Yuzuriha.

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,890
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

106
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,860
Even if thousands of years passed.

107
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,400
You've been alive since that day, too.

108
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,480
You survived! Good job, camphor tree!

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,060
You've been protecting Yuzuriha, didn't let her
get washed away or damaged.

110
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,540
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

111
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,470
No, I should say, you've been protecting me.

112
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,300
Because of you, I was able to stay alive.

113
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,780
In that hopeless darkness I spent centuries and
millenniums alone.

114
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,640
Alright, now I can finally say it.

115
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,270
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.

116
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,050
I'm gonna say what I wanted to that day.

117
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,870
I'm going to finish what I want to say that day
so long ago.

118
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,030
I love you.

119
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,740
I've loved you for centuries, for thousands
of years!

120
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,010
I will save you, Yuzuriha!

121
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,390
Even though I don't know how yet

122
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
but I will-

123
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,300
[Go down the river, big guy]

124
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,480
[Go down the river, big guy]
Go down the river, big guy.

125
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
[Go down the river, big guy]

126
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,320
You finally woke up, big guy.

127
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,810
You're still alive, Senku!

128
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,670
Don't come hug me when you're almost naked!

129
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,470
I'll kill you!

130
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,050
It's October 5th, 5738 today.

131
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,840
How long have you been asleep?

132
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,900
I woke up half a year ago and started working.

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,860
You mean, since that day...

134
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,510
about 3700 years have passed?

135
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,960
How do you know the exact date?

136
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,630
I counted it.

137
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,400
Is there another way?

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,680
4 5 6 7 8

139
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,130
Shit!

140
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,500
I almost lost consciousness again.

141
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,000
About every 800,000 seconds, a peak is reached.

142
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,240
It's like when you have diarrhea.

143
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,680
Think while you count.

144
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,910
Let your left and right brain balance the work.

145
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,270
116,427,065,530 seconds.

146
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:31,240
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

147
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,310
You kept counting in that darkness?

148
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,110
Even if I could wake up by my willpower,

149
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,720
if I wake up during the winter with nothing on me

150
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,330
I'd die immediately from the lack of food.

151
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,590
If I want to wake up during the spring

152
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,630
I had to know the exact date.

153
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,210
Okay, we're here.

154
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,420
Don't just talk, get to work.

155
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Senku, you...

156
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,120
You made all this from scratch?

157
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,850
I lacked man power,

158
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,340
I need a whole day just to prepare

159
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,490
the basic necessities.

160
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,880
In order to reach the next level of civilization

161
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,340
I need a physically strong helper.

162
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,340
I've been waiting for you, Taiju.

163
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,550
Because I was 10 billion percent sure you'd
survive.

164
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,380
You decided to confess to Yuzuriha,

165
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,560
how could you not persist a mere few thousand
years when you haven't fulfilled your wish yet?

166
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,170
You're not that kind of a good-for-nothing, are you?

167
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,630
Yes.

168
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,460
Of course!

169
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,700
I'll leave the thinking to you, Senku.

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,970
Leave the physical stuff to me!

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,800
The 2 million years humans needed to go from
the stone age to modern civilization,

172
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,500
I'll rush through it!

173
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,830
I will reconquer this world,

174
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,190
using science to unlock the principle of
petrification and revival.

175
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,870
And we'll save Yuzuriha!

176
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,080
We, two high school kids, will rebuild
civilization from scratch!

177
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,090
We will become the Adam and Eve of this
Stone World!

178
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,940
This is so exciting.

179
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,640
What a crazy amount.

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,820
Your physical strength is so astonishing,
Taiju.

181
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,370
Virosa, poisonous.

182
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,710
Hypsizygus tessellatus, eatable.

183
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,440
Fly agaric, poisonous.

184
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,590
It's obvious this Super Mario-like mushroom
is poisonous.

185
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,420
Next.

186
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,930
Mugwort, usable.

187
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
Wolf's-bane, do you want to die, you idiot?

188
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,890
It's delicious!

189
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,790
How did you flavor it?

190
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,330
I just used seawater salt.

191
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,260
With a little bit of salt, humans can eat
almost anything.

192
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,900
Salt is important to make pickled products, too.

193
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,810
It's the greatest discovery of primitive man.

194
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,620
Thank you, Senku. Thank you for all of this!

195
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,020
You spared no effort on so many things,

196
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,080
I will repay you with hard work and quantity!

197
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,040
I'll search the other side!

198
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,260
Wild grapes?

199
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,350
Is it eatable?

200
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,930
No use in thinking about it, I'll know once I eat it.

201
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,130
I've seen him on TV.

202
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,470
I think he's called "The Strongest Primate
High Schooler",

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,150
Shishio Tsukasa .

204
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,970
Even this guy was...

205
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,940
This is...

206
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,570
Someone else survived besides me and Senku?

207
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,240
Who put it here?

208
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,260
I did, idiot.

209
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,820
You!

210
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,860
Is there really no one else left in this world?

211
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,450
Our first objective is to increase the number
of humans.

212
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,320
If only the two of us old guys live

213
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,660
there will be no future for humanity.

214
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,890
You're right.

215
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,280
Besides,

216
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,050
why did our petrification end after 3700 years?

217
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,130
Because the stone eroded?

218
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,790
Even if it's caused by the eroding of this
mysterious stone,

219
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,220
we both woke up at around the same time, it is
too much of a coincidence.

220
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,160
That's a time difference of half a year
in relation to 3700 years.

221
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,580
There must be a reasonable explanation
for this coincidence.

222
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,570
You and I both drifted near this cave.

223
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,580
Look, those droplets.

224
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,190
A mysterious liquid created from bat dung.

225
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,060
Nitric acid.

226
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,400
What is nitric acid?

227
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,670
What is that?

228
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,010
I knew you'd ask that, big guy.

229
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,680
It's too much of a hassle, I'm not gonna explain it.

230
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,800
So if we pour this something-acid on it,

231
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,630
the stone will erode and it will revive?

232
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,610
I wish it was that easy.

233
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,730
I tried it countless of times.

234
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,000
I did everything I could think of.

235
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,920
I don't know how many times I've tried,

236
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,630
but in the end, it's a substance of a fantasy world.

237
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,630
Is it a mineral? Or cells?

238
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,220
I don't even have the equipment
to research that now.

239
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,500
There are things in this world
that even science can't solve?

240
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,850
Such a cliche thing to say.

241
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,310
That's why I keep proposing hypotheses and
doing experiments.

242
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,790
That's how dull science is.

243
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,460
Only if there was alcohol.

244
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,180
[Ethanol]

245
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,200
If we had alcohol,
[Ethanol]

246
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,250
[Ethanol]

247
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,030
By mixing nitric acid and ethanol
[Ethanol]

248
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,730
we could make Nital Etch.

249
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:15,900
[Corrosive agent]
[Nital Etch]

250
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,310
Which is an industrial corrosive.
[Corrosive agent]
[Nital]

251
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,640
[Corrosive agent]
[Nital]

252
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,150
What were you saying, Senku?

253
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,500
I was talking about nital.

254
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,300
It destroys minerals, the ferrite
grain boundary-

255
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,220
Not that! I can't understand something
that complex!

256
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,660
As long as you have alcohol.

257
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,410
Say, can't you make wine with grapes?

258
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,680
Good job, big guy!

259
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,140
Yes, you handle the physical stuff, that's
how it should be.

260
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,610
It's easy to make grape wine.

261
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,380
You only have to crush grapes or raisins and
put them in a container,

262
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,730
then you stir it every day.

263
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,250
But in our time, private winemaking is
against the law.

264
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,220
After three weeks...

265
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,520
It's almost done.

266
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,560
But Senku, are we drinking underage?

267
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,100
It's fine.

268
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,130
We are over 3700 years old.

269
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,550
That's true.

270
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,020
It's better than expected.

271
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,120
But it must be 100 billion times worse than
commercial wine.

272
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,490
I didn't know you can make grape wine this easily.

273
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,880
Gotta do it step by step.

274
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,560
Now, we need to do some work.

275
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,520
"Start the production method for brandy by
distilling the wine"

276
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,860
Distilling?

277
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,290
Totally confused.

278
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,110
I knew you'd say that.

279
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,720
First heat then cool the wine to make it condense

280
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,750
and increase the alcohol concentration.

281
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,160
Piece of cake.

282
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,980
3000 B.C.,

283
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,400
the people of the Mesopotamian civilization
were also distilling with pottery.

284
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,940
There's nothing you can't do, only things you
can't think of.

285
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,810
This is so exciting!

286
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,880
Let me tell you, big guy.

287
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,610
It's not that "there are things even science
can't solve",

288
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,430
if there's a puzzle you can't solve, find the
principle.

289
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,290
This simple and unremitting effort is called
science.

290
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,680
Itâ€™s been a year since the experiment started.
I didnâ€™t expect us to be this quick.

291
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,450
Itâ€™s really simple.

292
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,170
I will use science to overcome magic.

293
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,320
[Dr. Stone]

294
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,740
This is so exciting!

295
