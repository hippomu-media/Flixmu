August 2016

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,660
Can't sleep.

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,670
Huh? What's this?

Thank you all for waiting!

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,090
It's finally time for SucceedSoft's
big new announcement!

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,810
What big new announcement?

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,060
hype levels: low

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,310
time for another succeed sequel lol

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,780
I guess I remember an announcement
about an announcement.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,100

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,940

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,650

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,230

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,320
as long as it's good

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,940
I'd be glad for a new title even if it's a social game

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,400
it's still in development, so I bet stuff is still undecided

23
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,070
short version: it's another sequel

24
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,530

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,950
Sumi-pyon looks adorbs

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,280
This is it!

27
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,820
It's a brand new game!

28
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,820
Eroge! Eroge!

29
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,660

30
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,870

31
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,990
lol if it's a remake

32
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,660
i've got faith in the devs

33
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,660
it's been 30 years already...

40
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,920
Are you kidding me?

41
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
For real?

42
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,080
lol they're re-assembling the platinum gen

43
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,630
they're actually serious

44
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,880

47
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,920
even getting one platinum would be awesome, so three is huge

48
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,430
Kawagoe Kyouichi, N@NA,
and Akishima Shino?

49
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,540
huh????????

50
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,040
wow, I'm actually looking forward to this

51
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,710
herewegoherewegoherewego

52
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,460
whoooooa

53
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,710
N@NA-samahhhhhh

54
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,040
shino da god is here

55
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,670
This is what I've been waiting for

56
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,130
succeed's getting serious lol

57
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,420
they're getting the gen's biggest together lmao

58
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,710
this is actually a really big deal

59
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,880
They're all-stars
from the Platinum Generation!

60
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,880
I started crying the minute I saw Kawagoe Kyouchi's name

61
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,940
What kind of budget are they dealing with?

62
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,010
The reaction has to be crazy...

63
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,010
Succeed's new game

64
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,570
I shouldn't.

65
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,560
I always loved things like video games,
light novels, and anime.

66
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,240
I wanted to try working in the industry,

67
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,270
so I quit the office job I had
and joined a bishoujo game developer...

68
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,530
Where the workplace was more
terrible than I had ever imagined,

69
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,480
we released games that didn't sell,
and ultimately shut down.

70
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,330
My name's Hashiba Kyoya,
and I'm 28 years old.

71
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,270
The kind of soon-to-be-middle-aged bachelor

72
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,620
that you can find just about anywhere.

73
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,260
As you might expect, I've got
no girlfriend, and no money.

74
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,140
And now I don't even have a job...

75
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,110
Which means I can't pay rent anymore,

76
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,320
forcing me to pay for an express bus ticket
with the last of my cash.

77
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,580
And here I find myself here,
back at my parents' house.

78
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,200
Directing, video editing,
image editing, art assistant,

79
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,710
sub-scenario writing, logo design...

80
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,540
I tried my hand at everything I could,
and none of it amounted to anything.

81
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,320
What was the point of it all?

82
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,020
Akishima Shino is so amazing.

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,730
Hello?

101
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,080
Onii-chan? You doing okay?

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,370
Nope.

103
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,280
What's up?

104
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,190
Well, I was going through my stuff
and I found something of yours.

105
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,160
I thought I'd drop it off later.

106
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,690
Something of mine? What?

107
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,640
The letter from when
you got into art school.

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,140
You're proud of it, right?

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,850
I'll see you later, then.

110
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,600
Art school, huh?

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,710
I got into two schools,
and I wasn't sure which to attend.

112
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,390
One was the economics department
of a regular university.

113
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,100
The other was the visual arts
program of an art school.

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,120
My admiration for creatives lead me to
take the entrance exam on a lark...

115
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,150
But I passed somehow.

116
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,320
Notice of Acceptance

117
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,530
Exam ID:

118
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,280
Name: Hashiba Kyoya

119
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,280
This letter is to notify you of your acceptance
into the academic programs listed below for
the exam that you took in 2004.

120
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,580
But I didn't attend.

121
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,970
I didn't have the confidence
to try a creative career,

122
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,800
and regular college work seemed easier.

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,910
I wonder what would've happened
if I had gone to art school instead.

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:42,510
The Platinum Generation
"A convergence in the visual art department of Oonaka University of the Arts"
Kawagoe Kyoichi
N@NA
Akishima Shino

125
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,680
The Platinum Generation
are all the same age as me.

126
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,040
If I had gone to art school instead,

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,510
maybe I would've become
a creator, like them.

128
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,230
I wonder if I could wake up,
and be back in time...

129
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,430
And then I'd change things.

130
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,180
Onii-chan?

131
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,250
Onii-chan...

132
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,020
Onii-chan!

133
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,400
Would it kill you to knockâ€”

134
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,530
Here you go.

135
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,240
See ya.

136
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,850
You're welcome, by the way.

137
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,130
I guess it doesn't work that way.

138
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,840
We are contacting you to let you know you passed
the entrance exam to Oonaka University of the Arts
Visual Arts program that you took in 2004.

139
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,840
Hashiba Kyoya-sama

140
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,840
Number

141
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,840
Notice of Acceptance

142
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
There's nothing I can do now.

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,330
I'd better look for a job.

144
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,940
September 2016

145
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,840
We wish you luck in your future endeavors.

146
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,850
Don't do it!

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,700
I am so sorry!

148
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,160
Did I seriously look that suicidal?

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,650
Well... you looked kinda lonely, maybe?

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,570
I said kind of lonelyâ€”

151
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,180
S-Sorry!

152
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,290
Oh, sorry.

153
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,060
When I remembered what I was worried about,
I got pissed off all of a sudden.

154
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,940
It must be pretty serious.

155
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,580
Tell me about it!

156
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,950
We had staff run out on us
at a critical juncture.

157
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,210
They ran off?

158
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,120
Well, I work at a company
that makes games, right?

159
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,180
Though I guess it's not really
unheard of in this industry.

160
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,600
What are the odds that
I just stumble across someone

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,630
who can direct, edit images and video,

162
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,390
and has a general knowledge
of web development...

163
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,510
And since I'm asking, maybe they
could hook me up with an illustrator.

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,140
Uh...

165
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,390
What?

166
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,270
That sounds like me.

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,850
It does?

168
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,030
I think it does, anyway.

169
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,160
I can't believe I landed
a gig at SucceedSoft.

170
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,040
Better work hard! This is a big chance!

171
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,880

172
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,870
Welcome, Hashiba Kyoya-san.

173
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm the head of SucceedSoft's
second development group, Kawasegawa.

174
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,350
Nice to have you.

175
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,480
Right! I'm very glad to be working here!

176
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,020
She's the team head?

177
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,600
But she's only about my age...
or even younger.

178
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,320
Amazing.

179
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,820
I'm going to go ahead and explain
what you'll need to get started.

180
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,020
Right!

181
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Materials Room

182
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,030
This is the room where we've put
the reference material for our new title.

183
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,750
But we're short-staffed,
and you can see what that's led to.

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,880
I apologize you for sticking you
with basic chores for your first job, but...

185
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,270
I'm counting on you.

186
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,470
I shouldn't have expected too much, I guess.

187
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,540
I'll just be grateful to even have a job.

188
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,560
Huh?

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,480
Data

190
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Classmate 2

191
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Heroine 1 Accessory

192
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Park Play Sets

193
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Shopping District By Station

194
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Classmate 1

195
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Camera

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Tea Set

197
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,590
Wait, isn't this...

198
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,310
This should probably be like this.

199
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,090
And this like this...

200
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,690
Let's change how this is organized.

201
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,200
The filers were previously labeled
only with numbers.

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,890
So I labeled each type of file
with a letter of the alphabet,

203
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,840
and a number to distinguish them.

204
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,140
Characters

205
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,140
I made digital copies of anything
we didn't need hard copies of,

206
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,320
and filed the hard copies on the shelves.

207
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,150
I made sure to label the toys
and figurines too,

208
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,900
so now we can keep track of it all via PC.

209
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,320
So... what do you think?

210
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,280
Well, I have to say,
it's not what I expected.

211
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
Relax, though.

212
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,580
You exceeded those expectations.

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,960
October 2016

214
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,250
We can delay the deadline by a week,

215
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,140
but in exchange I'd like to see whatever
you have now, even if it's still rough.

216
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,890
That way we can get things rolling
for the backgrounds.

217
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,480
As for your next set of specs,
getting them ready by tonight is...

218
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,530
Sorry, it's going to have to
wait until tomorrow.

219
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,140
If you'll excuse me.

220
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,910
Thanks so much, Hashiba-san.

221
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,090
I don't know what it is, but that artist tends
to lose their temper with me really fast.

222
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,240
Your softball approach is a huge help.

223
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,620
Not a problem at all.

224
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,040
Just make sure to have the text
specifications ready for them.

225
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,920
Hashiba-san! About that tutorial video
for that item we talked about yesterday...

226
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,440
Don't worry! I've got it!

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,500
I'll make sure it's ready to check
at tomorrow's morning meeting.

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,830
Hashiba-san!

229
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,900
Do you have time to edit this image later?

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,170
Sure thing! I'll have it ready by tonight.

231
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,230
Hashiba-kun, I could use a hand...

232
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,040
Got it, I'll figure it out!

233
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,740
Hashiba, sorry, do you have a second?

234
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,760
Coming!

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,070
Never thought someone assuming I was
jumping off an overpass would be so fortunate.

236
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm glad we had that misunderstanding, too.

237
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,500
It still kind of hurts my feelings, though.

238
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,950
And I am really sorry about that!

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,720
I had a lot of worries back then.

240
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,380
I was feeling really fed up,
which was when you saw me.

241
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,150
It's kind of a mess
at our company, y'know.

242
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,840
Howso?

243
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,740
The team working on a social game
is calling us "budget parasites."

244
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,110
And they try to screw
with our development as a result.

245
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,870
But isn't this a big anniversary project?

246
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,560
Why would they do that?

247
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,200
Not everyone feels like celebrating.

248
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,190
And not caring about the anniversary
means they think it's all a waste.

249
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,460
But I want to make sure
this project is a success.

250
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,730
I don't want to waste a chance to work
with the Platinum Generation.

251
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,170
You really care about it, huh?

252
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,480
Having you on board has been a huge help.

253
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,560
Thank you so much.

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,360
That's okay. This is
a special project for me, too.

255
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,820
You really like Akishima Shino's art, huh?

256
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,050
Yeah.

257
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,060
The sooner you become
a permanent employee, the better.

258
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,910
How are my prospects, on that front?

259
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,150
Well, it's part of the contract.

260
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,320
After six months, you'll be
considered for the position.

261
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,330
I better work hard, then!

262
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,130
I bet you want to meet
the Platinum Gen soon, too.

263
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,240
Yeah!

264
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,380
November 2016

265
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,890
I hate to ask, but would we be able to get additional time?

266
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,940
We haven't gotten any
more of the script yet.

267
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,240
Having nothing show up
for a whole month isn't normal, right?

268
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,890
I wonder what the chief thinks.

269
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,260
She's been out a lot lately.

270
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,250
Everyone, can I have a word?

271
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,380
I have something I need to tell you all.

272
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,700
The Platinum project...

273
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,020
has been frozen, as decided
by a meeting of the board of directors.

274
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,140
Why?! What happened?

275
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,380
I wish I could have done more.

276
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,810
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,220
All that work, and for what?

278
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
What's gonna happen to our team?

279
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,480
Management only cares
about the social game, anyway.

280
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,480
Are we gonna be split up?

281
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,300
Damn it, this kills my motivation.

282
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,010
Guess I'm drinking myself silly tonight.

283
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,060
Again...

284
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,460
It happened again.

285
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,880
The team was laid off
and my contract was canceled.

286
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,140
What did I do wrong?

287
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,690
If I had chosen this instead...

288
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,800
I'd be pouring my heart into creating,
brainstorming with my friends,

289
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,430
thinking, then creating something new...

290
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:29,280
The Platinum Generation
"A convergence in the visual art department of Oonaka University of the Arts"
Kawagoe Kyoichi
N@NA
Akishima Shino

291
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,880
And I would've met
the Platinum Generation.

292
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,840
We could've worked together,
inspired each other...

293
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,130
And...

294
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,990
And then...

295
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,980
What the hell difference does it make?!

296
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,730
It's too late.

297
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,730
Onii-chan?

298
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,710
Onii-chan!

299
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,680
Onii-chan.

300
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
Finally. Were you so excited
you passed out, or something?

301
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,890
Come on... are you being sarcastic orâ€”

302
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,010
Uh... since when are you into cosplay?

303
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,490
What're you talking about?

304
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,240
Anyway, Dad wanted to to know what
you wanted for your celebratory dinner.

305
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,990
Celebrating?

306
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,910
You were freaking out
about getting in before.

307
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,650
"I got into Oonaka Arts!"

308
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,170
That was a decade ago.

309
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,750
Onii-chan, what are you talking about?

310
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,630
What do you mean? I could ask you...

311
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,150
Uh, did you borrow some of my books?

312
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,410
Sure didn't.

313
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,050
You always get mad when I do.

314
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,870
But... there's only the first seven
volumes of The Familiar of Zero.

315
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,980
Plus, Haganai, Asterisk,
and No Game, No Life are missing.

316
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,060
Huh?

317
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,190
Didn't we get rid of this CRT?

318
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,140
And...

319
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,240
Only a PreS2? What happened to the PreS3?

320
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,340
Maybe I should use my smartphone toâ€”

321
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,290
A flip phone?!

322
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,080
2006?!

323
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,180
"Once time passes, it never comes back."

324
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,060
"There are no second chances in life."

325
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,990
I always believed that...

326
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,990
But right now, what I am experiencing

327
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,910
Oonaka University of Art, Visual Arts Department

328
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,920
is the world from ten years ago that
I've been dying to go back to.

329
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,840
Oonaka University of Art

330
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
April 2006

331
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,240
I have no idea how it happened,
but I've reverted ten years into the past.

332
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,940
It's when I was choosing
what university to attend.

333
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,730
Where I was pondering my own future,

334
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,680
instead of pondering
the nature of the world.

335
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,470
I hope this is the right way?

336
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,710
Ichisuka Higashi... Ichisuka Higashi?

337
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,390
I take this right, then.

338
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,970
Back then, I chose the ordinary path
because I wasn't sure of my own potential.

339
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,420
As a result, I had some
seriously bitter experiences.

340
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,930
Which is why, when I found myself back in time,

341
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,860
there was only really one option.

342
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,990
Here we go.

343
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,320
Share House Kitayama.

344
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,210
Excuse me?

345
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,490
Am I the first one here?

346
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,860
This is Akashika Movers!

347
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,890
Coming!

348
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,390
Thank you.

349
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,470
Akashika Movers

350
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,440
All right, let's start putting stuff away.

351
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,820
The rest can wait until tomorrow.

352
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,320
My Dad asked me to make one promise:

353
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,390
Since your diet can become lopsided
when you're living on your own,

354
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,020
I have to eat plenty of fermented foods,

355
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,290
whether it comes
from lactic acid or from natto.

356
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,310
I really should have bought a sports
drink when I picked this up.

357
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,700
I'm an art student now.

358
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,610
Maybe I'll get to work together with
Akishima Shino, Kawagoe Kyouichi, and N@NA...

359
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,490
And then... I'll finally...

360
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,980
Finally...

361
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,180
Hashiba-kun?

362
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,090
Hashiba-kun...

363
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,880
Hashiba-kun.

364
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,820
Hashiba-kun!

365
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,180
Hashiba-kun...

366
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,030
What are you dozing off for, Hashiba-kun?

367
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,790
P-President?!

368
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,900
Am I back at my old job?!

369
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,450
Stop daydreaming!

370
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,230
The CG illustrations still aren't finished
for Pretty Booty, Hashiba-kun!

371
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,850
Where's that damn president?!

372
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,230
Mr. Prez, hope you're ready
to pay what you owe... with interest.

373
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,340
H-Hang on, this has to be a mistake!

374
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,740
Cut!

375
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,310
That's no good, Hashiba-kun!

376
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,500
You have to run from
the debt collectors, Hashiba-kun!

377
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,850
President?

378
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,850
Life isn't like a movie!
There are no second takes, Hashiba-kun!

379
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,230
Okay, let's try this again.

380
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,280
Take two, get ready...

381
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,390
Because there won't be a third, Hashiba-kun!

382
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,750
Now, run into the light!
The future is up to you, Hashiba-kun!

383
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,950
Scene 5, Cut 12, ready...

384
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,950
Action!

385
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,710
Where's that damn president?!

386
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,800
I can't let it end here!

387
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,550
No way is that happening!

388
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,150
What a nasty nightmare.

389
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,360
Where have I seen this before?

390
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Clothing: Her pajama top has partially slid off her shoulder,
with some of her bosom exposed.

391
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Situation: A girl is sleeping in front of the protagonist.

392
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Description

393
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,660
Oh, right, it was in an eroge we made.

394
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,140
I guess I haven't woken up yet.

395
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,880
Is it morning already?

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,340
So cute...

397
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,400
Y-Yes?

398
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,590
Thirsty...

399
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,020
Wait, I...

400
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,830
already... started on that.

401
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,170
Nothing beats yogurt in the morning!

402
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,590
Yeah, I agree.

403
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,240
Wait, hang on, who are you?

404
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,350
Oh, right, I better introduce myself.

405
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,770
What was that?!

406
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,740
It was on the second floor!

407
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,250
Hey, you okay in there?!

408
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,210
We're coming in!

409
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,180
W-Wait a sec!

410
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
What is it? What happâ€”

411
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,750
It's not what it looks like!

412
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,950
When I woke up, she was
sleeping next to me, andâ€”

413
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,890
Since my futon's not here yet, I borrowed his.

414
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,790
Wait, that's why?

415
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,430
Okay, I'll go first, then.

416
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,740
I'm Nanako Kogure!

417
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm originally from Shiga Prefecture!

418
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,310
You can call me Nanako!

419
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,940
Nice to meet you.

420
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,820
She seems kinda popular,
maybe a bit of a gyaru.

421
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,990
Let me guess: it was art school
or a life of crimeâ€”

422
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,590
You've got a talent
for being a pain in the ass

423
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,530
when I've only known you
for, like, 30 seconds.

424
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,570
Let's not make fun of her, then.

425
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm Tsurayuki Rokuonji...

426
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,420
I guess I'll keep it casual, too.

427
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,290
That's a cool family name!

428
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,260
More like pretentious.

429
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,440
What difference does my family name make?

430
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,890
Oh, so you're the only one
who can make fun of people?

431
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,240
I'll go next!

432
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,210
I'm Kyoya Hashiba.

433
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,460
Nice to meet you.

434
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,720
You can just call me Kyoya tooâ€”

435
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,700
In that case, Kyoya,
I need to clarify something...

436
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,700
Wh-What's that?

437
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,940
Could you explain the sequence of events
between yesterday and today in detail?

438
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,320
I already did, though!

439
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,340
It was a coincidence!
A series of unfortunate coincidences!

440
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,820
And, well...

441
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,200
So you coincidentally spent the night
with a girl you just met...

442
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,670
Before giving her a little bit
of the milky splash?

443
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,670
Seriously, it was just aâ€”

444
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,300
Unbelievable!

445
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,760
This should be interesting, I think.

446
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,040
That just leaves me!

447
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,460
I'm Shino Aki.

448
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,770
I'm from Fukuoka, in Kyushu...
a town called Itoshima.

449
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,040
Shinoaki's kind of a
masculine name, isn't it?

450
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,690
Yeah, you're right.

451
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,040
Aw, that ain't it though.

452
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,070
Shino's my family name, and Aki's my name.

453
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,120
S
H
I

454
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,120
N
O

455
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,120
A

456
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,120
K
I

457
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,120
So I'm Shino Aki!

458
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,990
Y'all can call me Aki, too.

459
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,440
What about Shinoaki, though?

460
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,180
I really like the sound of Shinoaki.

461
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,720
Shinoaki it is.

462
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,280
Are y'all not gonna listen to me?!

463
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,400
Shinoaki!

464
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,140
Share House
Kitayama

465
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,140
And that was how the four of us
ended up together in this share house.

466
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,140
Hashiba Kyoya
Shino Aki
Rokuonji Tsurayuki
Kogure Nanako

467
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,920
The second floor's rooms were
for me and Shinoaki,

468
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,140
with the bottom floor's being
for Tsurayuki and Nanako.

469
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,900
Household Chores
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMon       Tue      Wed      Thu       Fri        Sat      Sun
Kyoya      Cleaning  Errands  Trash    Cleaning  Cleaning   Errands  Trash
Tsurayuki  Cleaning  Cleaning  Errands  Trash    Cleaning  Cleaning  Errands
Nanako    Trash     Cleaning  Cleaning  Errands  Trash    Cleaning  Cleaning
Shinoaki   Errands   Trash    Cleaning  Cleaning  Errands  Trash    Cleaning

470
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,150
We split up the chores along these lines.

471
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:02,630
Chore Schedule
Kyoya       General household stuff
Tsurayuki  Taking the trash out, brute force labor
Nanako     Cleaning, occasionally cooking
Shinoaki    Helping everyone else

472
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,630
I won't go into all the specifics...
but it was kind of a mess.

473
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,350
I have to say...

474
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,250
Hey, what kinda stuff is in Shiga?

475
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,250
Being around two girls,
and both of them being so cute...

476
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,330
Well, there's Lake Biwa...

477
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,350
It's like something out of a dream.

478
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,630
Lake Biwa?

479
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,610
What else?

480
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,850
Other than that...

481
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,390
And considering what's already happened,

482
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,110
I should be careful about
anyone getting the wrong idea.

483
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,860
Imagine that, all of us
in the Visual Arts program...

484
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,850
Pretty wild coincidence, right?

485
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,980
Seems great to me. We can
share notes on class, and stuff.

486
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,280
But, man, is this really Osaka?

487
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,110
It's more rural than it is back home.

488
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,820
It's Osaka, but on the border
between prefectures.

489
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,770
I hear there used to be signs warning
about pit vipers until recently.

490
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,080
Caution
Pit Vipers!!

491
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,480
Maybe I should go home after all.

492
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,960
If you're gonna let some
snakes intimidate you...

493
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Then this is really gonna freak you out.

494
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,790
Oonaka Arts' signature landmark...
the Art Hill.

495
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,330
Right... I forgot all about it.

496
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,100
Kinda looks like the zone before
the final boss fulla tough enemies.

497
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,230
Visual Arts Program

498
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,230
Heisei 18 (2006)
Oonaka University of the Arts Visual Arts Program
New Student Guidance

499
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,950
Lotta new students
from the look of things.

500
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,350
A whole bunch.

501
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,370
A hundred... maybe more?

502
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,700
Yeah.

503
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,920
If the new students could be seated
in accordance to the numbered seats.

504
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,590
So he says.

505
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,420
See you all later, then.

506
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,560
Is this 33?

507
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,640
Brute Strength

508
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,770
That's right.

509
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,420
All right, cool. Pardon me, then.

510
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,150
I'm finally at art school!

511
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,950
The name's Hikawa Genkiro!

512
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,230
You write it with the "genki"
from "How you doing?!"

513
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,820
And the same "ro" as Ichiro
and Jiro! Genkiro!

514
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,570
Nice to meet you!

515
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,730
Uh...

516
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,490
I'm Hashiba Kyoya. Likewise.

517
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,110
So, Hashiba, did you play any sports?

518
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,120
Not in particular, no.

519
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,270
Just watched baseball on TV, really.

520
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,650
Baseball, huh? Chibalotti
did great last year!

521
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,660
And man, at last year's Koshien,
Koma-komai's Mii-kun was awesome!

522
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,060
Oh, right... that would've
been ten years ago, huh?

523
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,730
I guess the prince of towel's big showcase
is gonna be summer of this year...

524
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,020
You a fan of any players, Hashiba?

525
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,960
Uh...

526
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,790
Maybe Oodani?

527
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,530
Oodani? Doesn't ring any bells.

528
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,580
You know, he's a two-way player.

529
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,340
Who is?

530
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,840
Oh, uh...

531
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,040
You, uh, ever think about that neat saying,
"He who chases two hares, won't catch one"?

532
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,710
Crap, I need to choose
my words more carefully.

533
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,730
Now then, we have the advising
assistant professor Kano here,

534
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,340
who has a word for all of our new students.

535
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,580
Hey there! Nice to meet you everybody!

536
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm Assistant Professor Kano.

537
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,190
Welcome to art school!

538
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,560
That's our teacher?

539
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,540
She seems kinda young.

540
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,440
Now, to start out with,
I'd like to take an informal survey.

541
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,650
Okay, first of all, everyone wants
to direct movies, raise your hand!

542
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,910
Okay, next, who wants to be a screenwriter?

543
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,910
Anyone want to be an animator?

544
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,330
Game creators?

545
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,520
There's plenty of others, right?
Filming, recording, effects, editing...

546
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,480
All kinds of different careers!

547
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,310
I see, I see...

548
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,350
Okay, you all need to listen up!

549
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,770
First of all, we had 135 graduates
from the Visual Arts program last year.

550
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,770
How many of them do you think
landed the job they were after,

551
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,290
at the time of their admission?

552
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,570
You there, blondie.

553
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,120
U-Uh...

554
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,150
Forty-two, maybe?

555
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,500
Bzzt! Wrong.

556
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,460
Even that many would be like a dream, huh?

557
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,010
The correct answer is... eight of them.

558
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,850
Is that less than you expected?

559
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,040
And even that is better
than the previous year.

560
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,860
Let's change subjects, for a sec,
and talk about money.

561
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,040
People get hungry, they get tired,
and they have to use the bathroom.

562
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,100
We need clothes to wear,
and homes to live in.

563
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,370
I'm talking bare necessities.

564
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,850
And because everybody needs them,
they cost money.

565
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,540
But... how about movies,
anime, and video games?

566
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:08,080
Entertainment only becomes important
once you've got your needs met.

567
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,500
In other words, it's low priority.
Useless, you could even say.

568
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,010
And you all, who have come to a university
to learn to make those things...

569
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,350
Well, that goes all
the way past eccentricity...

570
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,660
And into stupidity.

571
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,270
Still, if you're good enough at being stupid?
You can make money off of it.

572
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,870
That is what you need to seek out.

573
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,930
If you're going to be stupid anyway,
do it in a way that no one else can touch.

574
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,290
I'm looking forward to seeing that happen.

575
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,750
That is all!

576
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,310
"It's not gonna be easy," in other words.

577
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,340
Now that I think about it, these
industries are not exactly expansive.

578
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,120
Whether it's movies, anime, or games...

579
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,580
There's only a tiny fraction of people

580
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,920
whose names get big enough
to become popular.

581
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,130
Even if the people from this generation
were known as "Platinum,"

582
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,930
it doesn't mean that every single one
of them shone bright.

583
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,980
I should know, considering
the future I came from.

584
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,240
But there's no sense in getting
depressed at the start.

585
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,810
Gotta focus on getting things done.

586
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,310
Excuse me, you dropped your student ID.

587
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,290
Who, me?

588
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,080
Wait, Chief?!

589
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,420
Wait, what? I'm not in any
clubs or anything yet.

590
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,430
Sorry.

591
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,680
Uh... wait...

592
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,100
Could you hand my ID over, please?

593
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,690
Oh, right.

594
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,190
Thanks.

595
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,360
Huh, so she was in the same program.

596
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,260
I might've been in the same room
as the Platinum Trio today!

597
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,670
Two Weeks Later

598
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Scene 16, Cut 1...

599
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,230
Ready... action!

600
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,750
And so, our Visual Arts classes began.

601
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,730
That said, it's not like we got
right into making movies.

602
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,970
We observed the older students' shoots...

603
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,570
And stuffed our heads full
of knowledge about the field.

604
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,680
Damn it, what kind
of kaiju beats the superhero?!

605
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,250
Sorry, heat of the moment...

606
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,160
Freshmen, that was
an example of what not to do.

607
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,830
Considering we were learning English verbs

608
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,420
and secondary functions
just a few months ago...

609
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,820
It's gonna take a while before things
like "the 180-degree rule" sink in.

610
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,030
Although in my case,
I was 28 years old a month ago.

611
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,830
You've got it all wrong!

612
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,680
There's one exception, though.

613
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,660
You're not positioned well.

614
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,870
Give it another pause
before stepping into the scene.

615
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,110
Camera, don't try and chase him down
with a pan. Pull out and hold.

616
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,110
Kawasegawa was already
at the center of the action.

617
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,010
Although she's a little
imposingly serious at times.

618
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,520
That's the chief for you.
She's on another level.

619
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,500
Screenplay Writing Theory

620
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,190
Compared to that, here I am...

621
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,100
wondering if I can really reach the level
of the Platinum Generation like this.

622
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,430
Tsurayuki, wake up!

623
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,320
Just a little bit more...
I'm wiped out from working all night.

624
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,840
In spite of everything I said,

625
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,700
the Share House Kitayama residents
seem to be taking things easy.

626
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,450
If you wanted to be nice,
you could say they're relaxed.

627
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,370
If you didn't, you could say they
don't seem motivated for class at all.

628
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,120
Which is kind of a relief, to be honest.

629
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,210
If everyone around me was like Kawasegawa...

630
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,220
I think I might've been
afraid to attend class.

631
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,320
Okay, when it comes to writing a script,

632
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,720
there are ten elements you need
for things to come together.

633
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,750
And yet you only see
eight here on the board.

634
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:44,320
Screenplay Writing Theory
The Ten Points of Screenplay Writing

635
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:44,320
Progress  Fate  Treasure  Resolution
Resonance  Climax  Conclusion  Themes

636
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,580
Seems kind of weird when
there's supposed to be ten, right?

637
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,930
Which is why I'm gonna ask you all
what the remaining two are.

638
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,030
Seriously?! I have no clue!

639
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,030
Any ideas?

640
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,990
Here.

641
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,620
Well, someone's fired up. And you are?

642
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,950
Kawasegawa Eiko.

643
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,750
Is one of the missing
elements "complications"?

644
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,290
"Complications" refers
to unpredictable turns in the story,

645
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,220
which tend to lead into
the protagonist or hero failing.

646
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,910
After all, no matter how
amazing an individual is,

647
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,220
they're less interesting
without some kind of flaw.

648
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,400
Having those faults come to the fore
during a story, and overcoming them,

649
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,770
creates interesting drama.

650
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,290
Correct you are. Perfect answer.

651
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,820
She really is something.

652
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,990
Can you tell me what the other one is, too?

653
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,890
I'd hate to hog all the
attention. I think...

654
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,570
I'd like to pass it off to the guy
who's snoring loudly behind me.

655
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,130
You're an interesting one,
Kawasegawa-kun. And mean.

656
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,800
Thank you, sir.

657
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,050
And since you went ahead
and gave up the spotlight...

658
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,680
Let's have sleepyhead here answer.

659
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,730
Someone call for me?

660
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,200
The professor did! He wants you
to name the missing element!

661
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,690
Missing what?

662
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,190
Ten Points of Screenplay Writing

663
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,240
Complications

664
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,240
Well? Don't you know?

665
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,350
If you don't, then pay more attention toâ€”

666
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,700
A foil.

667
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,800
Someone who becomes the protagonist's
"enemy" in the story, in other words.

668
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,670
It can be an individual,
or an organization...

669
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,910
Out of the other nine
principles you've got...

670
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,680
A simple way of putting it would be
"whoever steals the treasure."

671
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,940
Something to help maintain tension
until the climax of the story.

672
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,640
I figure it's a pretty important element.

673
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,550
Is that right?

674
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,470
You're quite the complication yourself.

675
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,820
But you're right. Well done.

676
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,980
Thank you, sir.

677
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,960
I take back what I said. Looks like
I won't be able to relax, after all.

678
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,170
Pork
Katsu
Meal

679
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,580
Mincemeat
Katsu

680
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,960
Fried
Chicken

681
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,960

682
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,960
Croquette
Meal

683
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
It wasn't a big deal...

684
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,920
I just recited something
I read in a book once.

685
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,310
I don't see how that earns any praise.

686
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,970
But that scary-looking teacher
flat-out praised you.

687
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,670
Learn to take a compliment!

688
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,490
He was just being nice to the freshman.

689
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,070
Start taking that kind of thing seriously,
and you'll never get anywhere.

690
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,560
Come on, Nanako. We've got
Visual Arts Theory for third period, right?

691
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,110
Oh, right.

692
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,110
See you two later.

693
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,630
Tsurayuki-kun's really something.

694
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,050
I don't get any of the jargon stuff,

695
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,290
so I'm barely able to keep up.

696
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,630
Same here.

697
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,250
That said...

698
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,050
I thought my extra ten years
would be an advantage.

699
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,260
That it'd make a big difference compared
to all the other students.

700
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,360
Even if it didn't amount to much,
I did actually work in entertainment.

701
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,220
It was supposed to give me
some kind of advantage.

702
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,160
But what I actually found out

703
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,150
is that my fundamental
knowledge is severely lacking.

704
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,110
A handful of sub-par experiences
isn't enough to equal knowledge or talent.

705
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,100
It feels like I'm learning
that the hard way.

706
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,430
What's wrong? You look real worried.

707
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,630
O-Oh, no...

708
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,380
It's nothing serious. Not really.

709
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,570
If you say so...

710
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,450
Come to think of it, why did Shinoaki...
apply to an arts school, anyway?

711
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,190
She was paying close attention
in photography class, but...

712
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,440
Maybe she wants to be a photographer?

713
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,260
Hikawa?

714
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,240
Yo!

715
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,470
Why are you dressed like that?

716
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,610
Come on, it's my club uniform!

717
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,250
A... uniform?

718
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,940
Hell yeah! There's only a handful
of them in the whole world...

719
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,140
A ninja club!

720
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,710
It's the Society for the Study
of Ninjutsu! I joined.

721
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,780
I think I've heard of that, actually.

722
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,610
In Japan, I think Oonaka Arts has the only one.

723
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,220
Yeah! Nice and exclusive, know what I mean?

724
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,010
Plus, one of the older
kunoichi girls is super hot.

725
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,930
I bet that's why he joined.

726
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,670
You sure are having fun, huh, Hikawa-kun?

727
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,450
Hell yeah! You two should check
out some extracurricular stuff, too.

728
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,940
It's seriously fun!

729
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,450
Are these the club rooms?

730
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,860
Seems like it.

731
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,710
Nobody's home, though.

732
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,500
Hey, hey!

733
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,330
Up here, you two!

734
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,340
You guys freshmen?

735
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,900
Uh, yes.

736
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,400
We are.

737
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,760
I knew it! That settles things, then.

738
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,020
The 2006 freshman mixer
is now officially underway!

739
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,360
Cheers!

740
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:23,560
We didn't even decide on a club
to join... Is this okay?

741
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,530
I figure it is.

742
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,930
They never asked us if we were in one!

743
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,460
True enough.

744
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,940
Say, Shinoaki...

745
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,280
What do you want to do?

746
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,250
Oh, you're awake?

747
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,400
Kyoya-kun...

748
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,200
Oh, sorry!

749
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,030
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

750
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,710
We've been busy non-stop
since the entrance ceremony, after all.

751
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,960
You're pretty sharp, Kyoya-kun.
It's hard to believe we're the same age.

752
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,210
You really think so?

753
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,560
Yeah! You pay a lot
of attention to everybody.

754
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,840
And you're calmer'n most
20-year-olds I know.

755
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,200
But sometimes you look like you're
tired from thinking too hard.

756
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,610
At lunch today, you looked real worried.

757
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,740
It's nothing serious, though. I mean it.

758
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,030
Ow, ow, ow...

759
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,250
Quit trying to brush me off and talk!

760
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,160
You might feel better that way.

761
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,800
Well, today... seeing Tsurayuki in class...

762
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,670
It made me realize how little I can do.

763
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,680
No... it's not just him.

764
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,430
Everybody at this school has something
that makes them special.

765
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,810
But I've got nothing. So...

766
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,440
I was thinking... about how little I can do.

767
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,420
And it had me worrying a lot.

768
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,850
That surprises me, because
I figured you could do anything.

769
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,440
I can't, though.

770
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,470
But you can cook
and keep yourself fed, right?

771
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,270
Yeah...

772
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,050
And do laundry, clean the house,
and keep things nice, right?

773
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,330
I can do that.

774
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,010
You can make plans
and actually stick to them, right?

775
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,350
That too.

776
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,340
I can't do any of that.

777
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,600
I'm jealous of people
who can, if I'm being honest.

778
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,160
Tsurayuki-kun probably feels the same way.

779
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,900
There's bound to be stuff
he's jealous of you for.

780
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:48,850
Folks who can't do anything
are all trying to find what we can do.

781
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:54,210
So I bet even the people
you think are amazing

782
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,120
are just as worried as you are.

783
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,510
There, there.

784
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,940
Shinoaki... listen...

785
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,600
Thanks.

786
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,230
I better do my best, too, huh?

787
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,140
What can I do?

788
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,080
We're home.

789
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,060
I guess they're both at work.

790
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,520
I'm gonna head to bed, then.

791
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,350
Yeah.

792
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,700
Our next report...

793
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:50,150
A man was reported for causing
a scene in Dotonbori.

794
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,100
I'm exhausted for today.
I'll work on my assignment tomorrow.

795
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,090
When approached for a...

796
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,000
I think I'll take a bath.

797
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,100
Oh, I forgot to hand it to her.

798
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,560
I wonder if she's asleep already.

799
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,650
Shinoaki? Are you awake?

800
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,130
Akishima Shino... is Shinoaki.

801
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:42,850
Folks who can't do anything
are all trying to find what we can do.

802
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,480
I see. That's what she wants to do, then.

803
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,730
I need to find something, too.

804
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,120
What do I want to do?

805
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,720
And what is it that I can do?
